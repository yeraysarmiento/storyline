# STORYLINE: Your online Sports Goods Shop

Project done with React / Redux and Javascript, CSS and used ESLint & Prettier for linter.

I have also used axios for JSON-server for running a server from React-App and 'axios' to make API's calls.
I worked using React Router v6 for navigation.
In order to implement unique id's I have used library 'uuid'.

## Available Scripts

Since it has a test server developed with JSON-server, you need to run it first:

### 'npm server'

It will run your local server in port 4000.

### 'npm start'

Runs de app in port 3000.

### 'npm test'

Due the lack of time I focused on 3 test Components, to show how to implement unit testing regarding to rendering and userEvents.
Tested with JEST using testing-library.
